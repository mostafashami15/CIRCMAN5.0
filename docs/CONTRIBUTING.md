# Contributing to CIRCMAN5.0 Documentation

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CIRCMAN5.0 documentation! This guide will help you understand the process and standards for contributing to our documentation.

Good documentation is essential for the usability, maintainability, and adoption of CIRCMAN5.0. By contributing to the documentation, you're helping users and developers understand and effectively use our platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin contributing to the documentation, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of Markdown syntax
- Familiarity with the CIRCMAN5.0 component you want to document

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Fork the CIRCMAN5.0 repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mostafashami15/CIRCMAN5.0
   cd circman5
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your documentation changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/your-documentation-topic
   ```

## Documentation Structure

CIRCMAN5.0 documentation follows a specific structure to ensure consistency and ease of navigation:

```
docs/
├── api/              # API reference documentation
├── architecture/     # System architecture documents
├── diagrams/         # Architectural and technical diagrams
├── guides/           # Integration and usage guides
├── implementation/   # Implementation guides
├── mathematical/     # Mathematical foundations
├── troubleshooting/  # Troubleshooting guides
└── user/             # User manuals
```

When adding new documentation, please place it in the appropriate directory based on its content and purpose.

## File Naming Conventions

Please follow these conventions when naming documentation files:

1. Use lowercase letters
2. Use underscores (`_`) instead of spaces
3. Be descriptive but concise
4. Use `.md` extension for Markdown files
5. Use prefixes to indicate the component being documented:
   - `dt_` for Digital Twin
   - `hmi_` for Human-Machine Interface
   - `lca_` for Lifecycle Assessment
   - etc.

Examples of good file names:
- `dt_state_management.md`
- `hmi_dashboard_customization.md`
- `lca_impact_factors.md`

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Format

All documentation should be written in Markdown format. If you're not familiar with Markdown, please reference this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Document Structure

Each document should follow this general structure:

1. **Title**: Use a single `#` heading at the top
2. **Introduction**: Brief overview of what the document covers
3. **Main Content**: Organized into logical sections with appropriate headings
4. **Examples**: Where applicable, provide code examples or usage examples
5. **Related Documentation**: Links to related docs (optional)
6. **References**: Citations or external resources (optional)

### Headings

Use headings to organize your document:

- `#` for the document title (use only once)
- `##` for major sections
- `###` for subsections
- `####` for sub-subsections (use sparingly)

### Code Examples

Code examples should be formatted using fenced code blocks with the appropriate language identifier:

```python
def example_function():
    """This is an example function."""
    return "Hello, World!"
```

For inline code, use backticks: `variable_name`.

### Links

For internal links to other documentation files, use relative paths:

```markdown
See the [Digital Twin API Reference](../api/dt_api_reference.md) for more information.
```

For external links, use the full URL:

```markdown
More information can be found in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/).
```

### Images and Diagrams

Place images and diagrams in the appropriate subdirectory:
- Technical diagrams should go in the `diagrams` directory
- User interface screenshots should go in the `user/images` directory

Reference images using relative paths:

```markdown
![Digital Twin Architecture](../diagrams/dt_architecture.svg)
```

### Tables

Use Markdown tables for tabular data:

```markdown
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| name | string | The name of the component |
| value | number | The value of the parameter |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the component is enabled |
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### General Guidelines

1. **Be Clear and Concise**: Use simple language and avoid unnecessary words
2. **Use Active Voice**: "The system generates reports" instead of "Reports are generated by the system"
3. **Be Consistent**: Use consistent terminology throughout the documentation
4. **Explain Why**: Include not just how to use features, but why and when to use them
5. **Include Examples**: Provide practical examples that users can follow
6. **Consider the Audience**: Write for your intended audience (developers, users, etc.)
7. **Keep it Updated**: Documentation should reflect the current state of the system

### API Documentation

When documenting APIs, include:

1. **Purpose**: What the API does
2. **Parameters**: What parameters it accepts, their types and meanings
3. **Return Values**: What the API returns, including types and examples
4. **Exceptions**: What exceptions it might raise
5. **Examples**: Code examples showing how to use the API
6. **Notes**: Any important considerations or caveats

Example:

```markdown
## `get_state(state_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`

Retrieves the specified state from the Digital Twin.

### Parameters:
- `state_id` (str): The unique identifier of the state to retrieve

### Returns:
Dictionary containing the state data with the following structure:
```python
{
    "timestamp": datetime,
    "values": {
        "parameter1": value1,
        "parameter2": value2,
        ...
    }
}
```

### Exceptions:
- `StateNotFoundError`: If the specified state_id does not exist
- `DatabaseError`: If there is an error accessing the state database

### Example:
```python
try:
    state = digital_twin.get_state("state_20250315_123045")
    print(f"State timestamp: {state['timestamp']}")
    print(f"Parameter value: {state['values']['temperature']}")
except StateNotFoundError:
    print("State not found")
```

### Notes:
- State IDs are typically in the format `state_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Older states might be archived and have slower retrieval times
```

### User Documentation

When writing user documentation:

1. **Use Screenshots**: Include screenshots of the user interface
2. **Provide Step-by-Step Instructions**: Break down complex tasks into simple steps
3. **Explain Options**: Describe what each option or setting does
4. **Include Troubleshooting**: Address common issues users might encounter
5. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent formatting for UI elements, buttons, etc.

## Contribution Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Commit your changes with a clear commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: Add Digital Twin state management documentation"
   ```
3. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin docs/your-documentation-topic
   ```
4. Create a pull request from your fork to the main CIRCMAN5.0 repository
5. Fill in the pull request template with details about your documentation changes

### Documentation Review Process

All documentation contributions will be reviewed by the documentation team. The review process checks for:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Is the information correct?
2. **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary aspects of the topic?
3. **Clarity**: Is it easy to understand?
4. **Consistency**: Does it follow our documentation standards?
5. **Grammar and Spelling**: Is the text well-written and free of errors?

### Addressing Review Feedback

If changes are requested during the review:

1. Make the requested changes in your local branch
2. Commit and push the changes to your fork
3. The pull request will be updated automatically
4. Respond to the reviewer's comments to indicate what changes you've made

## Documentation Testing

### Internal Links

Before submitting your contribution, please test all internal links to ensure they work correctly.

### Code Examples

If your documentation includes code examples, ensure they are correct and runnable.

### Building Docs Locally

You can build the documentation locally to see how it looks:

```bash
# Install MkDocs
pip install mkdocs

# Build the documentation
mkdocs build

# Serve the documentation locally
mkdocs serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the built documentation.
