# Lifecycle Assessment Mathematical Foundations

## 1. Introduction

This document provides the mathematical foundations for the Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) system in CIRCMAN5.0. It details the models, equations, and methodologies used to calculate environmental impacts throughout the photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing lifecycle. Understanding these mathematical foundations is essential for accurate implementation, validation, and extension of the LCA system.

## 2. Life Cycle Assessment Framework

### 2.1 General Mathematical Framework

Life Cycle Assessment follows a structured mathematical approach that can be generalized as:

$$Impact = \sum_{i} (Inventory_i \times CharacterizationFactor_i)$$

Where:
- $Impact$ is the environmental impact in the impact category of interest
- $Inventory_i$ is the quantity of elementary flow $i$
- $CharacterizationFactor_i$ is the factor relating elementary flow $i$ to the impact category

This framework is applied across all lifecycle phases and impact categories.

### 2.2 System Boundary Definition

The system boundary for PV manufacturing LCA is mathematically represented as a set of processes:

$$S = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}$$

Where $S$ is the system and $p_i$ are individual processes included in the assessment.

For CIRCMAN5.0, the system boundary encompasses:
- Raw material extraction
- Material processing
- Manufacturing
- Use phase
- End-of-life management

### 2.3 Functional Unit

All calculations are normalized to a functional unit, which for PV manufacturing is typically:

$$FU = 1 \text{ kWh of electricity generated}$$

Or alternatively:

$$FU = 1 \text{ m}^2 \text{ of PV panel area}$$

The choice of functional unit affects all subsequent calculations through normalization.

## 3. Manufacturing Phase Impact Calculations

### 3.1 Material Impact Formula

The environmental impact of materials in manufacturing is calculated as:

$$I_{materials} = \sum_{m \in M} (Q_m \times F_m)$$

Where:
- $I_{materials}$ is the total material impact (kg CO2-eq)
- $M$ is the set of all materials
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $F_m$ is the impact factor for material $m$ (kg CO2-eq/kg)

### 3.2 Energy Impact Formula

The manufacturing energy impact is calculated as:

$$I_{energy} = \sum_{e \in E} (Q_e \times F_e)$$

Where:
- $I_{energy}$ is the total energy impact (kg CO2-eq)
- $E$ is the set of all energy sources
- $Q_e$ is the quantity of energy from source $e$ (kWh)
- $F_e$ is the impact factor for energy source $e$ (kg CO2-eq/kWh)

### 3.3 Process-Specific Impact Formula

For specific manufacturing processes, the impact is calculated as:

$$I_{process} = \sum_{p \in P} (N_p \times F_p)$$

Where:
- $I_{process}$ is the total process impact (kg CO2-eq)
- $P$ is the set of all processes
- $N_p$ is the number of times process $p$ is performed
- $F_p$ is the impact factor for process $p$ (kg CO2-eq/process)

### 3.4 Total Manufacturing Impact

The total manufacturing impact combines material, energy, and process impacts:

$$I_{manufacturing} = I_{materials} + I_{energy} + I_{process}$$

### 3.5 Quality Considerations

Material quality affects waste generation through the following relationship:

$$W_m = Q_m \times (1 - q_m)$$

Where:
- $W_m$ is the waste generated for material $m$ (kg)
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $q_m$ is the quality factor for material $m$ (0 to 1)

This waste quantity affects material consumption and recycling calculations.

## 4. Use Phase Impact Calculations

### 4.1 Energy Generation Model

The energy generation over the lifetime is modeled with degradation:

$$E_{total} = \sum_{t=1}^{L} E_{annual} \times (1 - d)^{t-1}$$

Where:
- $E_{total}$ is the total lifetime energy generation (kWh)
- $E_{annual}$ is the annual energy generation (kWh)
- $d$ is the annual degradation rate (decimal)
- $L$ is the system lifetime (years)
- $t$ is the year index

### 4.2 Avoided Grid Emissions

The use phase impact (avoided emissions) is calculated as:

$$I_{use} = -E_{total} \times GCI$$

Where:
- $I_{use}$ is the use phase impact (kg CO2-eq, negative value representing avoided emissions)
- $E_{total}$ is the total lifetime energy generation (kWh)
- $GCI$ is the grid carbon intensity (kg CO2-eq/kWh)

The negative sign indicates that this is an avoided impact (benefit).

### 4.3 Degradation Models

Different degradation models can be applied:

1. **Linear Degradation**:
   $$E_t = E_0 \times (1 - d \times t)$$

2. **Exponential Degradation**:
   $$E_t = E_0 \times e^{-kt}$$

3. **Stepwise Degradation**:
   $$E_t = E_0 \times (1 - d_t)$$

Where:
- $E_t$ is the energy generation in year $t$
- $E_0$ is the initial annual energy generation
- $d$ is the annual degradation rate
- $k$ is the degradation constant
- $d_t$ is the cumulative degradation by year $t$

CIRCMAN5.0 primarily uses the first model (equivalent to equation 4.1).

## 5. End-of-Life Impact Calculations

### 5.1 Recycling Benefit Formula

The recycling benefit is calculated as:

$$I_{recycling} = \sum_{m \in M} (Q_m \times r_m \times B_m)$$

Where:
- $I_{recycling}$ is the recycling benefit (kg CO2-eq, typically negative)
- $M$ is the set of all materials
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $r_m$ is the recycling rate for material $m$ (0 to 1)
- $B_m$ is the recycling benefit factor for material $m$ (kg CO2-eq/kg, typically negative)

### 5.2 Transport Impact Formula

The transport impact for end-of-life handling is:

$$I_{transport} = \frac{\sum_{m \in M} Q_m}{1000} \times D \times T_f$$

Where:
- $I_{transport}$ is the transport impact (kg CO2-eq)
- $M$ is the set of all materials
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $D$ is the transport distance (km)
- $T_f$ is the transport impact factor (kg CO2-eq/tonne-km)
- Division by 1000 converts kg to tonnes

### 5.3 Total End-of-Life Impact

The total end-of-life impact combines recycling benefits and transport impacts:

$$I_{end-of-life} = I_{recycling} + I_{transport}$$

### 5.4 Material Recovery Models

More detailed material recovery models can be applied:

$$R_m = Q_m \times r_m \times e_m$$

Where:
- $R_m$ is the recovered quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $r_m$ is the recycling rate for material $m$ (0 to 1)
- $e_m$ is the recovery efficiency for material $m$ (0 to 1)

This recovered material can then offset virgin material production in future lifecycles.

## 6. Total Life Cycle Impact

### 6.1 Carbon Footprint Summation

The total carbon footprint across all lifecycle phases is:

$$I_{total} = I_{manufacturing} + I_{use} + I_{end-of-life}$$

Where each term represents the impact from the respective lifecycle phase.

### 6.2 Net Environmental Benefit Calculation

The net environmental benefit is calculated as:

$$NEB = -I_{use} - I_{recycling}$$

Where both terms are typically negative (representing benefits).

### 6.3 Energy Payback Time

The energy payback time (EPBT) is calculated as:

$$EPBT = \frac{E_{embedded}}{E_{annual} \times (1 - d)^{(EPBT-1)/2}}$$

Where:
- $EPBT$ is the energy payback time (years)
- $E_{embedded}$ is the embedded energy in manufacturing (kWh)
- $E_{annual}$ is the annual energy generation (kWh)
- $d$ is the annual degradation rate

This is typically solved iteratively as EPBT appears on both sides.

### 6.4 Environmental Return on Investment

The environmental ROI is calculated as:

$$EROI = \frac{NEB}{|I_{manufacturing} + I_{transport}|}$$

Where the denominator represents the absolute value of environmental investments.

## 7. Impact Factor Derivation

### 7.1 Material Impact Factors

Material impact factors are derived from life cycle inventory (LCI) databases using:

$$F_m = \sum_{e \in E_m} (Q_{e,m} \times C_e)$$

Where:
- $F_m$ is the impact factor for material $m$ (kg CO2-eq/kg)
- $E_m$ is the set of all emissions associated with material $m$
- $Q_{e,m}$ is the quantity of emission $e$ per kg of material $m$
- $C_e$ is the characterization factor for emission $e$ (kg CO2-eq/kg emission)

### 7.2 Energy Impact Factors

Energy impact factors are derived similarly:

$$F_e = \sum_{p \in P_e} (Q_{p,e} \times C_p)$$

Where:
- $F_e$ is the impact factor for energy source $e$ (kg CO2-eq/kWh)
- $P_e$ is the set of all pollutants associated with energy source $e$
- $Q_{p,e}$ is the quantity of pollutant $p$ per kWh from energy source $e$
- $C_p$ is the characterization factor for pollutant $p$

### 7.3 Grid Carbon Intensity Modeling

Grid carbon intensity can be modeled dynamically as:

$$GCI(t) = \sum_{s \in S} (f_s(t) \times F_s)$$

Where:
- $GCI(t)$ is the grid carbon intensity at time $t$ (kg CO2-eq/kWh)
- $S$ is the set of all energy sources in the grid
- $f_s(t)$ is the fraction of electricity from source $s$ at time $t$
- $F_s$ is the impact factor for energy source $s$ (kg CO2-eq/kWh)

This allows for modeling grid decarbonization scenarios.

## 8. Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis

### 8.1 Uncertainty Propagation

The uncertainty in impact calculations is propagated using:

$$\sigma_{I_{total}}^2 = \sum_{i} \sigma_{Q_i}^2 \cdot F_i^2 + \sum_{i} Q_i^2 \cdot \sigma_{F_i}^2 + \sum_{i} \sum_{j \neq i} \rho_{ij} \cdot \sigma_{Q_i} \cdot \sigma_{Q_j} \cdot F_i \cdot F_j + \sum_{i} \sum_{j \neq i} \rho_{ij} \cdot Q_i \cdot Q_j \cdot \sigma_{F_i} \cdot \sigma_{F_j}$$

Where:
- $\sigma_{I_{total}}^2$ is the variance of the total impact
- $\sigma_{Q_i}^2$ is the variance of quantity $i$
- $\sigma_{F_i}^2$ is the variance of impact factor $i$
- $\rho_{ij}$ is the correlation coefficient between variables $i$ and $j$

### 8.2 Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation generates a distribution of impacts:

$$I_{total}^{(k)} = f(Q_1^{(k)}, Q_2^{(k)}, ..., Q_n^{(k)}, F_1^{(k)}, F_2^{(k)}, ..., F_n^{(k)})$$

Where:
- $I_{total}^{(k)}$ is the total impact for Monte Carlo iteration $k$
- $Q_i^{(k)}$ is the sampled value of quantity $i$ for iteration $k$
- $F_i^{(k)}$ is the sampled value of impact factor $i$ for iteration $k$
- $f$ is the impact calculation function

The distribution of $I_{total}^{(k)}$ across all iterations provides uncertainty information.

### 8.3 Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity coefficients for each parameter are calculated as:

$$S_i = \frac{\partial I_{total}}{\partial P_i} \cdot \frac{P_i}{I_{total}}$$

Where:
- $S_i$ is the sensitivity coefficient for parameter $i$
- $P_i$ is the parameter value
- $\frac{\partial I_{total}}{\partial P_i}$ is the partial derivative of the total impact with respect to parameter $i$

This represents the percentage change in impact for a percentage change in the parameter.

## 9. Scenario Comparison Methods

### 9.1 Absolute Difference Calculation

The absolute difference between scenarios is calculated as:

$$\Delta I = I_{alternative} - I_{baseline}$$

Where:
- $\Delta I$ is the impact difference
- $I_{alternative}$ is the impact of the alternative scenario
- $I_{baseline}$ is the impact of the baseline scenario

### 9.2 Relative Difference Calculation

The relative (percentage) difference is calculated as:

$$\Delta I_{\%} = \frac{I_{alternative} - I_{baseline}}{I_{baseline}} \times 100\%$$

This provides a normalized comparison between scenarios.

### 9.3 Multiple Scenario Comparison

For multiple scenarios, a comparison matrix can be constructed:

$$C_{ij} = \frac{I_i - I_j}{I_j} \times 100\%$$

Where:
- $C_{ij}$ is the comparison value between scenarios $i$ and $j$
- $I_i$ is the impact of scenario $i$
- $I_j$ is the impact of scenario $j$

This matrix allows systematic comparison across multiple scenarios.

## 10. Additional Impact Categories

### 10.1 Water Consumption

Water consumption is calculated as:

$$W_{total} = \sum_{m \in M} (Q_m \times W_m) + \sum_{p \in P} (N_p \times W_p)$$

Where:
- $W_{total}$ is the total water consumption (m³)
- $M$ is the set of all materials
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $W_m$ is the water consumption factor for material $m$ (m³/kg)
- $P$ is the set of all processes
- $N_p$ is the number of times process $p$ is performed
- $W_p$ is the water consumption factor for process $p$ (m³/process)

### 10.2 Land Use

Land use impact is calculated as:

$$L_{total} = \sum_{m \in M} (Q_m \times L_m)$$

Where:
- $L_{total}$ is the total land use (m²)
- $M$ is the set of all materials
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $L_m$ is the land use factor for material $m$ (m²/kg)

### 10.3 Material Intensity

Material intensity is calculated as:

$$MI = \frac{\sum_{m \in M} Q_m}{A}$$

Where:
- $MI$ is the material intensity (kg/m²)
- $M$ is the set of all materials
- $Q_m$ is the quantity of material $m$ (kg)
- $A$ is the panel area (m²)

This metric helps evaluate material efficiency.

## 11. Implementation Considerations

### 11.1 Computational Complexity

The computational complexity of LCA calculations scales linearly with the number of materials and processes:

$$O(|M| + |P|)$$

Where:
- $|M|$ is the number of materials
- $|P|$ is the number of processes

For Monte Carlo simulations, the complexity becomes:

$$O(N \times (|M| + |P|))$$

Where $N$ is the number of Monte Carlo iterations.

### 11.2 Numerical Stability

Certain calculations may encounter numerical stability issues, particularly when using iterative solvers for equations like EPBT. Bounded optimization techniques can be applied:

$$EPBT_{n+1} = \frac{E_{embedded}}{E_{annual} \times (1 - d)^{(EPBT_n-1)/2}}$$

With constraints:
$$0 \leq EPBT \leq L$$

Where $L$ is the system lifetime.

### 11.3 Data Interpolation

For missing intermediate data points, linear interpolation is used:

$$y = y_1 + \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} \times (y_2 - y_1)$$

Where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are known data points, and $(x, y)$ is the interpolated point.

## 12. Advanced Modeling Techniques

### 12.1 Dynamic LCA Modeling

Dynamic LCA incorporates time-dependent factors:

$$I(t) = \sum_{i} (Q_i(t) \times F_i(t))$$

Where both quantities and impact factors can vary over time.

### 12.2 Consequential LCA

Consequential LCA models market effects of production changes:

$$\Delta I = \sum_{i} \Delta Q_i \times (F_i + \sum_{j} \frac{\partial Q_j}{\partial Q_i} \times F_j)$$

Where:
- $\Delta I$ is the change in impact
- $\Delta Q_i$ is the change in production of product $i$
- $\frac{\partial Q_j}{\partial Q_i}$ represents the market-mediated effect of product $i$ on product $j$

### 12.3 Input-Output LCA

For broader system boundaries, input-output analysis can be used:

$$\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1} \times \mathbf{Y}$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{X}$ is the vector of total production
- $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix
- $\mathbf{A}$ is the technology matrix of input coefficients
- $\mathbf{Y}$ is the final demand vector

The total impact is then:
$$\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{X}$$

Where $\mathbf{B}$ is the environmental intervention matrix.
