## Introduction

The AI/ML Enhancement components build upon foundational mathematical principles of statistical learning theory, optimization, and uncertainty estimation. These principles enable robust prediction, continuous adaptation, and reliable uncertainty quantification for manufacturing optimization.

The general framework for manufacturing optimization can be expressed as finding optimal parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*$ that maximize performance:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}^* = \arg\max_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} f(\boldsymbol{\theta})$$

where $f(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ represents manufacturing performance (efficiency, quality, resource utilization) as a function of parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. The AI/ML components implement sophisticated approaches to model $f(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and find optimal parameters.

## Deep Learning Models

### Neural Network Foundations

The deep learning models implement neural networks that approximate complex manufacturing relationships. A neural network with $L$ layers can be described as a composition of functions:

$$f(\mathbf{x}) = f^{(L)} \circ f^{(L-1)} \circ \cdots \circ f^{(1)}(\mathbf{x})$$

where each layer function $f^{(l)}$ is defined as:

$$f^{(l)}(\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)}) = \sigma(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)})$$

with:
- $\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)}$ representing the output of the previous layer
- $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ as the weight matrix for layer $l$
- $\mathbf{b}^{(l)}$ as the bias vector for layer $l$
- $\sigma(\cdot)$ as the activation function

### LSTM Architecture

For time-dependent manufacturing processes, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used, which implement memory cells with input, forget, and output gates:

$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{f}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_f\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_f\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_f)\\
\mathbf{i}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_i\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_i\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_i)\\
\mathbf{o}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_o\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_o\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_o)\\
\tilde{\mathbf{c}}_t &= \tanh(\mathbf{W}_c\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_c\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_c)\\
\mathbf{c}_t &= \mathbf{f}_t \odot \mathbf{c}_{t-1} + \mathbf{i}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_t\\
\mathbf{h}_t &= \mathbf{o}_t \odot \tanh(\mathbf{c}_t)
\end{align}$$

where:
- $\mathbf{f}_t, \mathbf{i}_t, \mathbf{o}_t$ represent the forget, input, and output gates
- $\mathbf{c}_t$ is the cell state
- $\mathbf{h}_t$ is the hidden state
- $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function
- $\mathbf{W}_*, \mathbf{U}_*, \mathbf{b}_*$ are learnable parameters

### Training Algorithm

The training of neural networks follows gradient-based optimization of a loss function $\mathcal{L}$:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_t - \alpha \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$$

where:
- $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ represents model parameters at step $t$
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ is the gradient of the loss function

For regression tasks in manufacturing, the mean squared error (MSE) loss is typically used:

$$\mathcal{L}_{MSE}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}_i))^2$$

### Regularization

To prevent overfitting to manufacturing data, regularization techniques are employed:

$$\mathcal{L}_{reg}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \lambda \Omega(\boldsymbol{\theta})$$

where $\Omega(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the regularization term and $\lambda$ controls its strength.

For L2 regularization:

$$\Omega(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{i,j} (W_{ij}^{(l)})^2$$

Dropout regularization randomly sets a fraction $p$ of inputs to zero during training, effectively training an ensemble of sub-networks.

## Ensemble Methods

### Random Forest

Random Forest uses an ensemble of decision trees to improve robustness and performance:

$$f_{RF}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}f_t(\mathbf{x})$$

where $f_t(\mathbf{x})$ is the prediction of the $t$-th tree, and $T$ is the total number of trees.

Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and at each node, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting:

$$\text{split}(j, s) = \arg\max_{\text{feature}~j, \text{threshold}~s} \text{gain}(j, s)$$

The impurity gain is calculated as:

$$\text{gain}(j, s) = I(S) - \frac{|S_L|}{|S|}I(S_L) - \frac{|S_R|}{|S|}I(S_R)$$

where:
- $I(S)$ is the impurity measure (e.g., variance for regression)
- $S_L, S_R$ are the left and right child nodes after splitting
- $|S|$ is the number of samples in node $S$

### Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting builds an ensemble by sequentially adding weak learners that correct the errors of previous models:

$$f_m(\mathbf{x}) = f_{m-1}(\mathbf{x}) + \nu \cdot h_m(\mathbf{x})$$

where:
- $f_m(\mathbf{x})$ is the model after $m$ iterations
- $h_m(\mathbf{x})$ is the weak learner at iteration $m$
- $\nu$ is the learning rate

The weak learner $h_m$ is trained to approximate the negative gradient of the loss function:

$$h_m \approx \arg\min_h \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ -\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(y_i, f_{m-1}(\mathbf{x}_i))}{\partial f_{m-1}(\mathbf{x}_i)} - h(\mathbf{x}_i) \right]^2$$

For mean squared error loss, this simplifies to:

$$h_m \approx \arg\min_h \sum_{i=1}^{n} [r_{im} - h(\mathbf{x}_i)]^2$$

where $r_{im} = y_i - f_{m-1}(\mathbf{x}_i)$ are the residuals.

### Stacking Ensemble

Stacking combines multiple base models with a meta-model that learns optimal combinations:

$$f_{stack}(\mathbf{x}) = g\Big(f_1(\mathbf{x}), f_2(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_K(\mathbf{x})\Big)$$

where:
- $f_k(\mathbf{x})$ are base models (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting)
- $g(\cdot)$ is the meta-model (e.g., linear regression, ridge regression)

The training proceeds in two stages:
1. Train base models using cross-validation to generate meta-features
2. Train meta-model on base model predictions

## Online Learning Theory

### Adaptive Model Framework

The adaptive model continuously updates based on new data while managing the trade-off between stability and adaptability. The general update equation is:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_t + \eta_t \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \mathcal{L}_t(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$$

where:
- $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ represents model parameters at time $t$
- $\eta_t$ is the time-dependent learning rate
- $\mathcal{L}_t$ is the loss function at time $t$

### Weighted Buffer Management

The adaptive model maintains a buffer of recent data with time-decaying weights:

$$w_i^{(t+1)} = \gamma w_i^{(t)}$$

where:
- $w_i^{(t)}$ is the weight of the $i$-th sample at time $t$
- $\gamma \in (0, 1)$ is the forgetting factor

The weighted loss function becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \ell(f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

### Model Aging and Regeneration

The model regeneration policy is based on the model age function:

$$A(t) = t - t_{creation}$$

The model is regenerated when:

$$A(t) > T_{max}$$

where $T_{max}$ is the maximum allowed model age.

## Uncertainty Quantification

### Prediction Intervals

For a regression model $f(\mathbf{x})$, the prediction interval at confidence level $1-\alpha$ is:

$$PI(\mathbf{x}, 1-\alpha) = [f(\mathbf{x}) - z_{1-\alpha/2} \cdot \hat{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}), f(\mathbf{x}) + z_{1-\alpha/2} \cdot \hat{\sigma}(\mathbf{x})]$$

where:
- $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the standard normal quantile
- $\hat{\sigma}(\mathbf{x})$ is the estimated prediction standard deviation

### Monte Carlo Dropout

Monte Carlo Dropout estimates prediction uncertainty by performing multiple forward passes with dropout enabled:

$$\hat{\sigma}^2_{MC}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \Big(f^t(\mathbf{x}) - \overline{f}(\mathbf{x}) \Big)^2 + \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma^2_t(\mathbf{x})$$

where:
- $f^t(\mathbf{x})$ is the prediction from the $t$-th forward pass
- $\overline{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} f^t(\mathbf{x})$ is the mean prediction
- $\sigma^2_t(\mathbf{x})$ is the inherent noise variance (often assumed constant)

### Ensemble Variance

For ensemble models, uncertainty can be estimated using variance across ensemble members:

$$\hat{\sigma}^2_{ensemble}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \Big(f_m(\mathbf{x}) - \overline{f}(\mathbf{x}) \Big)^2$$

where:
- $f_m(\mathbf{x})$ is the prediction from the $m$-th ensemble member
- $\overline{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} f_m(\mathbf{x})$ is the ensemble mean prediction

### Calibration

To ensure accurate uncertainty estimates, calibration techniques are employed. Temperature scaling adjusts the variance:

$$\hat{\sigma}^2_{calibrated}(\mathbf{x}) = T \cdot \hat{\sigma}^2(\mathbf{x})$$

where $T$ is the temperature parameter optimized to minimize the negative log-likelihood:

$$\mathcal{L}(T) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log p(y_i | \mathbf{x}_i, T)$$

For Gaussian likelihood:

$$\mathcal{L}(T) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi T \hat{\sigma}^2(\mathbf{x}_i)) + \frac{(y_i - f(\mathbf{x}_i))^2}{2T\hat{\sigma}^2(\mathbf{x}_i)} \right]$$

## Digital Twin Integration

### State Mapping

The integration with the Digital Twin involves mapping between physical state space $\mathcal{S}_p$ and model parameter space $\mathcal{P}_m$:

$$\phi: \mathcal{S}_p \rightarrow \mathcal{P}_m$$

The inverse mapping transforms optimized parameters back to state updates:

$$\phi^{-1}: \mathcal{P}_m \rightarrow \Delta\mathcal{S}_p$$

### Multi-Objective Optimization

The integration enables multi-objective optimization balancing multiple manufacturing goals:

$$\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \left[ f_1(\boldsymbol{\theta}), f_2(\boldsymbol{\theta}), \ldots, f_k(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \right]^T$$

subject to constraints:

$$\begin{align}
g_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}) &\leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m\\
h_j(\boldsymbol{\theta}) &= 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p
\end{align}$$

This is solved using scalarization techniques like weighted sum:

$$\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i f_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$$

where $w_i$ are weights defining the trade-off between objectives.

### Closed-Loop Control

The Digital Twin integration enables closed-loop control with the following dynamics:

$$\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$$

$$\mathbf{u}(t) = \pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}(t))$$

where:
- $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the system state
- $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input
- $f$ is the system dynamics
- $\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ is the control policy parameterized by $\boldsymbol{\theta}$

The AI system continuously updates the policy $\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ based on observed outcomes.
