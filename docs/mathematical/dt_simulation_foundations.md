# Digital Twin Simulation Foundations

## 1. Introduction

This document provides the mathematical foundations for the simulation capabilities of the CIRCMAN5.0 Digital Twin system. It covers the modeling approaches, numerical methods, and algorithms used in the simulation engine to predict system behavior and support what-if analysis.

## 2. Simulation Paradigm

### 2.1 Discrete Event vs. Continuous Time

The Digital Twin simulation engine implements a hybrid approach:

1. **Time-Discretized Continuous Dynamics**: Core physical processes are modeled as continuous dynamics evaluated at discrete time steps
2. **Discrete Event Processing**: State transitions and operational changes are handled as discrete events

This hybrid approach allows the simulation to efficiently model both smooth physical phenomena and discrete operational states.

### 2.2 Time Advancement

Time advancement follows a fixed-step approach:

$$t_{k+1} = t_k + \Delta t$$

Where:
- $t_k$ is the current time step
- $t_{k+1}$ is the next time step
- $\Delta t$ is the time step size

The simulation uses a consistent time step for simplicity and stability, typically in the range of minutes for manufacturing process simulation.

## 3. Process Dynamics Models

### 3.1 Temperature Dynamics

Temperature evolution is modeled as a first-order approach to a target value with random fluctuations:

$$T_{k+1} = T_k + \alpha_T (T_{target} - T_k) + \omega_T$$

Where:
- $T_k$ is the current temperature
- $T_{k+1}$ is the temperature at the next time step
- $T_{target}$ is the target temperature
- $\alpha_T$ is the temperature regulation parameter (0 < $\alpha_T$ < 1)
- $\omega_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_T^2)$ is a random fluctuation

This model captures the thermal inertia of the system, where temperature changes gradually approach the target value rather than changing instantaneously.

### 3.2 Energy Consumption Model

Energy consumption follows different dynamics based on the operational state:

$$E_{k+1} = \begin{cases}
E_k + \Delta E \cdot \nu, & \text{if status = "running"} \\
E_k \cdot \beta_E, & \text{if status = "idle"}
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $E_k$ is the current energy consumption
- $E_{k+1}$ is the energy consumption at the next time step
- $\Delta E$ is the base energy increment when running
- $\nu \sim \mathcal{N}(1, \sigma_E^2)$ is a random variation factor
- $\beta_E$ is the energy decay factor during idle periods (typically 0.95)

This conditional model captures different behavior based on the system's operational status, with increasing consumption during operation and decreasing consumption during idle periods.

### 3.3 Production Rate Model

Production rate dynamics incorporate temperature effects and operational state:

$$P_{k+1} = \begin{cases}
P_k \cdot (1 + (\Delta P \cdot \gamma_T - \kappa) \cdot \nu), & \text{if status = "running"} \\
P_k \cdot \beta_P, & \text{if status = "idle"}
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $P_k$ is the current production rate
- $P_{k+1}$ is the production rate at the next time step
- $\Delta P$ is the base production rate increment
- $\gamma_T = 1 - \frac{|T_k - T_{optimal}|}{T_{range}}$ is the temperature impact factor
- $\kappa$ is a decay constant (typically 0.1)
- $\nu \sim \mathcal{N}(1, \sigma_P^2)$ is a random variation factor
- $\beta_P$ is the production rate decay factor during idle periods (typically 0.8)

This model incorporates the impact of temperature deviation from optimal on production rate, with maximum production occurring at the optimal temperature.

### 3.4 Material Consumption Model

Material inventory follows a production-dependent consumption model:

$$M_{i,k+1} = M_{i,k} - P_k \cdot c_i \cdot (1 + \epsilon_i)$$

Where:
- $M_{i,k}$ is the inventory of material $i$ at time step $k$
- $M_{i,k+1}$ is the inventory at the next time step
- $P_k$ is the production rate
- $c_i$ is the consumption rate for material $i$
- $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_M^2)$ is a random consumption variation

This model links material usage directly to production rate with small random variations to account for process inconsistencies.

### 3.5 Quality Model

Quality is modeled as a function of multiple process variables:

$$Q_{k+1} = Q_k + \alpha_Q (Q_{max} - Q_k) - \beta_Q |T_k - T_{optimal}| - \gamma_Q P_k + \omega_Q$$

Where:
- $Q_k$ is the current quality factor
- $Q_{k+1}$ is the quality factor at the next time step
- $Q_{max}$ is the maximum quality achievable
- $\alpha_Q$ is the quality improvement parameter
- $\beta_Q$ is the temperature deviation impact on quality
- $\gamma_Q$ is the production rate impact on quality
- $\omega_Q \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_Q^2)$ is a random fluctuation

This model captures quality as being affected by temperature deviation from optimal and production rate, with an approach toward maximum quality over time.

### 3.6 Defect Rate Model

Defect rate dynamics incorporate smoothing and multiple influences:

$$D_{k+1} = \beta_D \cdot D_k + (1 - \beta_D) \cdot [D_{base} + \alpha_D |T_k - T_{optimal}| + \gamma_D P_k] + \omega_D$$

Where:
- $D_k$ is the current defect rate
- $D_{k+1}$ is the defect rate at the next time step
- $D_{base}$ is the base defect rate
- $\beta_D$ is the smoothing factor
- $\alpha_D$ is the temperature impact parameter
- $\gamma_D$ is the production rate impact parameter
- $\omega_D \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_D^2)$ is a random fluctuation

This model applies exponential smoothing to defect rate changes while incorporating production rate and temperature effects.

## 4. Implementation Techniques

### 4.1 Numerical Integration Methods

The simulation implements several numerical integration methods:

#### 4.1.1 Euler Method

The simplest method, using first-order approximation:

$$x_{k+1} = x_k + h \cdot f(x_k, u_k)$$

Where:
- $x_k$ is the current state
- $x_{k+1}$ is the next state
- $h$ is the time step
- $f(x_k, u_k)$ is the state derivative function
- $u_k$ is the input vector

#### 4.1.2 Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method

For more complex dynamics requiring higher accuracy:

$$k_1 = f(x_k, u_k)$$
$$k_2 = f(x_k + \frac{h}{2}k_1, u_k)$$
$$k_3 = f(x_k + \frac{h}{2}k_2, u_k)$$
$$k_4 = f(x_k + hk_3, u_k)$$
$$x_{k+1} = x_k + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)$$

This fourth-order method provides higher accuracy for the same step size as the Euler method.

### 4.2 Stochastic Components

The simulation incorporates stochasticity through:

1. **Gaussian Noise**: Added to deterministic models
   $$\omega \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$

2. **Random Variation Factors**: Multiplicative noise for process parameters
   $$\nu \sim \mathcal{N}(1, \sigma^2)$$

3. **State-Dependent Variance**: Variance scaling with state magnitude
   $$\sigma(x) = \sigma_{base} \cdot |x|^{\alpha}$$

These stochastic components allow the simulation to capture real-world variability and uncertainty.

### 4.3 State Transition Handling

Discrete state transitions are handled through conditional logic:

```python
def simulate_next_state(current_state):
    """Generate the next state using physics-based models."""
    # Create a copy of the current state
    next_state = copy.deepcopy(current_state)

    # Update timestamp
    next_state["timestamp"] = calculate_next_timestamp(current_state["timestamp"])

    # Get operational status
    status = current_state.get("production_line", {}).get("status", "idle")

    # Apply appropriate dynamics based on status
    if status == "running":
        # Apply running dynamics
        next_state = apply_running_dynamics(next_state)
    elif status == "idle":
        # Apply idle dynamics
        next_state = apply_idle_dynamics(next_state)
    elif status == "maintenance":
        # Apply maintenance dynamics
        next_state = apply_maintenance_dynamics(next_state)

    # Apply common dynamics for all states
    next_state = apply_common_dynamics(next_state)

    # Apply constraints
    next_state = apply_constraints(next_state)

    return next_state
```

## 5. Scenario Analysis

### 5.1 Parameter Variation

Scenario analysis involves varying parameters systematically:

$$\theta^{(j)} = \theta_{base} + \Delta\theta^{(j)}$$

Where:
- $\theta^{(j)}$ is the parameter value for scenario $j$
- $\theta_{base}$ is the baseline parameter value
- $\Delta\theta^{(j)}$ is the parameter modification for scenario $j$

Multiple scenarios can be compared by running simulations with different parameter sets:

$$X^{(j)} = \{x_0^{(j)}, x_1^{(j)}, ..., x_T^{(j)}\}$$

Where $X^{(j)}$ is the state trajectory for scenario $j$.

### 5.2 What-If Analysis

What-if analysis evaluates the impact of parameter changes on key performance indicators (KPIs):

$$KPI^{(j)} = g(X^{(j)})$$

Where:
- $KPI^{(j)}$ is the KPI value for scenario $j$
- $g$ is the KPI evaluation function
- $X^{(j)}$ is the state trajectory for scenario $j$

Common KPIs include:
- Production Total: $P_{total}^{(j)} = \sum_{k=0}^{T} P_k^{(j)}$
- Energy Efficiency: $E_{eff}^{(j)} = \frac{P_{total}^{(j)}}{E_{total}^{(j)}}$
- Average Quality: $Q_{avg}^{(j)} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=0}^{T} Q_k^{(j)}$
- Defect Rate: $D_{avg}^{(j)} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=0}^{T} D_k^{(j)}$

### 5.3 Scenario Comparison

Scenarios are compared using relative performance metrics:

$$\Delta KPI_{rel}^{(j)} = \frac{KPI^{(j)} - KPI^{(base)}}{KPI^{(base)}} \times 100\%$$

Where:
- $\Delta KPI_{rel}^{(j)}$ is the relative KPI change for scenario $j$
- $KPI^{(j)}$ is the KPI value for scenario $j$
- $KPI^{(base)}$ is the KPI value for the baseline scenario

This allows direct comparison of percentage improvements or deteriorations across different KPIs.

## 6. Monte Carlo Simulation

### 6.1 Uncertainty Quantification

Monte Carlo methods quantify uncertainty in simulation outputs:

$$p(y) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \delta(y - f(\theta_i))$$

Where:
- $\theta_i \sim p(\theta)$ are parameter samples
- $f(\theta_i)$ is the model output for parameter sample $\theta_i$
- $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function
- $N$ is the number of Monte Carlo samples

This approach provides a distribution of possible outcomes rather than a single deterministic result.

### 6.2 Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals quantify the uncertainty in predictions:

$$[y_{lower}, y_{upper}] = [\hat{y} - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \hat{\sigma}, \hat{y} + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \hat{\sigma}]$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$ is the mean predicted value
- $\hat{\sigma}$ is the standard deviation of predictions
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the z-score for the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence)

This provides a range within which the true value is expected to lie with a specified confidence.

### 6.3 Implementation

The Monte Carlo simulation is implemented as:

```python
def monte_carlo_simulation(base_state, parameters, n_samples=100, steps=10):
    """Run Monte Carlo simulation with parameter variation."""
    results = []

    for i in range(n_samples):
        # Generate sample parameters with random variation
        sample_params = {}
        for param, value in parameters.items():
            # Apply random variation to each parameter
            if isinstance(value, (int, float)):
                # Numeric parameters get percentage variation
                variation = random.normalvariate(1.0, 0.05)  # 5% std dev
                sample_params[param] = value * variation
            else:
                # Non-numeric parameters unchanged
                sample_params[param] = value

        # Run simulation with sample parameters
        simulation_result = run_simulation(base_state, sample_params, steps)

        # Extract final state for analysis
        final_state = simulation_result[-1]

        # Add to results
        results.append(final_state)

    # Calculate statistics
    statistics = calculate_statistics(results)

    return results, statistics
```

## 7. Parameter Estimation

### 7.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation

For parameter estimation from observations, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is used:

$$\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = \arg\max_{\theta} \log p(y_{1:T} | \theta)$$

Where:
- $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate
- $y_{1:T}$ are the observed outputs
- $p(y_{1:T} | \theta)$ is the likelihood of observations given parameters

For normally distributed output errors, this becomes:

$$\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = \arg\min_{\theta} \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{(y_t - f_t(\theta))^2}{2\sigma^2}$$

Which is equivalent to least squares estimation when the variance $\sigma^2$ is constant.

### 7.2 Bayesian Parameter Estimation

For Bayesian parameter estimation:

$$p(\theta | y_{1:T}) \propto p(y_{1:T} | \theta) p(\theta)$$

Where:
- $p(\theta | y_{1:T})$ is the posterior distribution of parameters
- $p(y_{1:T} | \theta)$ is the likelihood of observations given parameters
- $p(\theta)$ is the prior distribution of parameters

This approach incorporates prior knowledge about parameters and provides a distribution rather than a point estimate.

### 7.3 Implementation

Parameter estimation is implemented using optimization methods:

```python
def estimate_parameters(observed_data, parameter_ranges, n_iterations=100):
    """Estimate model parameters from observed data."""
    def objective_function(params):
        # Run simulation with these parameters
        simulated_data = run_simulation_with_params(params)

        # Calculate error between simulation and observations
        error = calculate_error(simulated_data, observed_data)

        return error

    # Define parameter bounds
    bounds = [(param_range[0], param_range[1])
              for param_name, param_range in parameter_ranges.items()]

    # Run optimization
    result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess,
                     method='L-BFGS-B', bounds=bounds)

    # Extract estimated parameters
    estimated_params = result.x

    return estimated_params
```

## 8. Sensitivity Analysis

### 8.1 Local Sensitivity Analysis

Local sensitivity analysis quantifies the effect of small parameter variations:

$$S_i = \frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta_i} \frac{\theta_i}{y}$$

Where:
- $y$ is the output of interest
- $\theta_i$ is the parameter
- $S_i$ is the sensitivity coefficient

This dimensionless coefficient represents the percentage change in output given a percentage change in the parameter.

### 8.2 Global Sensitivity Analysis

Global sensitivity analysis examines parameter effects across their entire range:

$$V_i = \text{Var}_{\theta_i}[E_{\theta_{\sim i}}(y|\theta_i)]$$
$$S_i = \frac{V_i}{\text{Var}(y)}$$

Where:
- $V_i$ is the variance of the conditional expectation
- $\text{Var}_{\theta_i}$ is the variance with respect to $\theta_i$
- $E_{\theta_{\sim i}}$ is the expectation over all parameters except $\theta_i$
- $S_i$ is the Sobol' first-order sensitivity index

This approach decomposes the total output variance into contributions from each parameter.

### 8.3 Implementation

Sensitivity analysis is implemented as:

```python
def sensitivity_analysis(base_state, base_params, steps=10):
    """Perform sensitivity analysis on parameters."""
    # Run baseline simulation
    baseline_results = run_simulation(base_state, base_params, steps)
    baseline_kpis = calculate_kpis(baseline_results)

    # Parameter perturbation size (5%)
    delta = 0.05

    sensitivities = {}
    for param_name, param_value in base_params.items():
        if not isinstance(param_value, (int, float)):
            continue

        # Create perturbed parameters
        perturbed_params = base_params.copy()
        perturbed_params[param_name] = param_value * (1 + delta)

        # Run simulation with perturbed parameter
        perturbed_results = run_simulation(base_state, perturbed_params, steps)
        perturbed_kpis = calculate_kpis(perturbed_results)

        # Calculate sensitivity for each KPI
        param_sensitivities = {}
        for kpi_name, baseline_value in baseline_kpis.items():
            perturbed_value = perturbed_kpis[kpi_name]

            # Avoid division by zero
            if abs(baseline_value) < 1e-10:
                sensitivity = 0.0
            else:
                relative_output_change = (perturbed_value - baseline_value) / baseline_value
                relative_input_change = delta
                sensitivity = relative_output_change / relative_input_change

            param_sensitivities[kpi_name] = sensitivity

        sensitivities[param_name] = param_sensitivities

    return sensitivities
```

## 9. Stability Analysis

### 9.1 Linear Stability Analysis

For linearized systems, stability is determined by eigenvalues:

$$\lambda_i(A) = \text{eigenvalues of } A$$

Where $A$ is the Jacobian matrix of the system:

$$A_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$$

The system is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts:

$$\text{Re}(\lambda_i) < 0 \quad \forall i$$

### 9.2 Numerical Stability

Numerical stability is ensured by proper time step selection:

For explicit methods like Euler, the time step must satisfy:

$$\Delta t < \frac{2}{|\lambda_{max}|}$$

Where $\lambda_{max}$ is the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude.

For oscillatory systems, additional constraints apply:

$$\Delta t < \frac{2}{\omega_{max}}$$

Where $\omega_{max}$ is the maximum frequency in the system.

### 9.3 Implementation

Stability checks are implemented as:

```python
def check_stability(parameters):
    """Check stability of simulation with given parameters."""
    # Calculate approximate Jacobian
    jacobian = calculate_numerical_jacobian(parameters)

    # Calculate eigenvalues
    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(jacobian)

    # Check stability condition
    is_stable = all(eigenvalue.real < 0 for eigenvalue in eigenvalues)

    # Calculate critical time step
    if is_stable:
        max_eigenvalue = max(abs(eigenvalue) for eigenvalue in eigenvalues)
        critical_dt = 2.0 / max_eigenvalue
    else:
        critical_dt = None

    return {
        "is_stable": is_stable,
        "eigenvalues": eigenvalues,
        "critical_dt": critical_dt
    }
```

## 10. Code Implementation

### 10.1 Simulation Step Implementation

The core simulation step is implemented as:

```python
def _simulate_next_state(self, current_state):
    """Generate the next state using physics-based models."""
    # Create a copy of the current state
    next_state = copy.deepcopy(current_state)

    # Update timestamp
    if "timestamp" in current_state:
        next_state["timestamp"] = self._advance_timestamp(current_state["timestamp"])
    else:
        next_state["timestamp"] = datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()

    # Simulate production line
    if "production_line" in next_state:
        next_state["production_line"] = self._simulate_production_line(
            next_state["production_line"]
        )

    # Simulate materials
    if "materials" in next_state and "production_line" in next_state:
        production_rate = next_state["production_line"].get("production_rate", 0.0)
        next_state["materials"] = self._simulate_materials(
            next_state["materials"],
            production_rate
        )

    # Simulate environment
    if "environment" in next_state:
        next_state["environment"] = self._simulate_environment(
            next_state["environment"]
        )

    # Apply constraints to ensure valid state
    next_state = self._apply_constraints(next_state)

    return next_state

## 11. Advanced Simulation Techniques

### 11.1 State Estimation

When partial observations are available, state estimation can be performed:

$$\hat{x}_{t|t} = E[x_t | y_{1:t}]$$

Where:
- $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is the estimated state at time $t$ given observations up to time $t$
- $y_{1:t}$ are the observations up to time $t$

Common state estimation methods include:
- Kalman Filter (for linear systems)
- Extended Kalman Filter (for nonlinear systems)
- Particle Filter (for highly nonlinear/non-Gaussian systems)

### 11.2 Hybrid Systems

For systems with continuous dynamics and discrete events:

$$\begin{cases}
\dot{x}(t) = f_q(x(t), u(t)) \\
q^+ = \delta(q, x, u)
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $x(t)$ is the continuous state
- $q$ is the discrete state
- $f_q$ is the continuous dynamics for discrete state $q$
- $\delta$ is the discrete state transition function
- $q^+$ is the next discrete state

This formulation handles both continuous evolution and discrete state transitions.

### 11.3 Multi-Scale Modeling

For systems with widely varying time scales:

$$\begin{cases}
\dot{x}_{fast}(t) = f_{fast}(x_{fast}(t), x_{slow}(t), u(t)) \\
\dot{x}_{slow}(t) = \epsilon \cdot f_{slow}(x_{fast}(t), x_{slow}(t), u(t))
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $x_{fast}$ are fast-changing state variables
- $x_{slow}$ are slow-changing state variables
- $\epsilon \ll 1$ is a small parameter
- $f_{fast}$ and $f_{slow}$ are the respective dynamics

This approach allows efficient simulation of systems with multiple time scales.
