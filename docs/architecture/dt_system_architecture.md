# Digital Twin System Architecture

## 1. Overview

The Digital Twin system in CIRCMAN5.0 is a comprehensive software implementation that provides a digital representation of the physical PV manufacturing system. This document describes the overall architecture, component organization, and interactions within the Digital Twin subsystem.

## 2. Architectural Principles

The Digital Twin system follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between core functionality, state management, simulation, and integrations.
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Critical components implemented as singletons to ensure consistent system state.
3. **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: Event-driven communication between components.
4. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive required dependencies through their constructors.
5. **Thread Safety**: All shared resources protected for concurrent access.
6. **Configurability**: Components configurable through a centralized constants service.

## 6. Architectural Patterns

### 6.1 Singleton Pattern

Critical components are implemented as singletons to ensure consistent system state:

```python
def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    """Ensure only one instance is created."""
    if cls._instance is None:
        with cls._init_lock:
            if cls._instance is None:
                cls._instance = super(SingletonClass, cls).__new__(cls)
    return cls._instance
```

### 6.2 Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

The Event Notification System implements a publisher-subscriber pattern:

```python
# Publisher
event_manager.publish(event)

# Subscriber
event_manager.subscribe(handler, category=EventCategory.THRESHOLD)
```

### 6.3 Adapter Pattern

The Digital Twin Adapter implements the adapter pattern to simplify access to the digital twin from the human interface:

```python
# Adapter simplifies complex digital twin operations
result = digital_twin_adapter.run_simulation(steps=10, parameters=parameters)
```

### 6.4 Factory Pattern

Configuration objects are created using factory methods:

```python
@classmethod
def from_constants() -> DigitalTwinConfig:
    """Factory method to create configuration from constants."""
    constants_service = ConstantsService()
    config = constants_service.get_digital_twin_config()
    # Transform configuration...
    return instance
```

## 7. State Structure

The digital twin uses a hierarchical state structure that represents all aspects of the manufacturing system:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-02-24T14:30:22.123456",
    "system_status": "running",
    "production_line": {
        "status": "running",
        "temperature": 22.5,
        "energy_consumption": 120.5,
        "production_rate": 8.3,
        "efficiency": 0.92,
        "defect_rate": 0.02
    },
    "materials": {
        "silicon_wafer": {
            "inventory": 850,
            "quality": 0.95
        },
        "solar_glass": {
            "inventory": 420,
            "quality": 0.98
        }
    },
    "environment": {
        "temperature": 22.0,
        "humidity": 45.0
    }
}
```

## 8. Data Flow

### 8.1 State Updates

1. External sources provide data to the Digital Twin Core
2. The Digital Twin Core validates and processes the data
3. The State Manager updates the current state
4. The Digital Twin Core publishes state update events
5. Event subscribers react to state changes

```
External Source → Digital Twin Core → State Manager → Event System → Subscribers
```

### 8.2 Simulation Flow

1. User or system requests simulation with parameters
2. Digital Twin Core initiates simulation
3. Simulation Engine processes simulation steps
4. Results are returned to Digital Twin Core
5. Digital Twin Core publishes simulation result events

```
Request → Digital Twin Core → Simulation Engine → Results → Event System
```

### 8.3 Optimization Flow

1. AI Integration extracts parameters from current state
2. AI models optimize parameters based on objectives
3. Optimized parameters are validated through simulation
4. Validated parameters are applied to digital twin
5. Results are published as optimization events

```
State → AI Integration → Optimization → Simulation → State Update → Events
```

## 9. Thread Safety

The digital twin system implements thread safety for all shared resources:

1. Locks protect state access and updates
2. Event publishing and subscription is thread-safe
3. Configuration access is synchronized
4. Component initialization is protected by locks

Example implementation:

```python
def update_state(self, updates: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Update parts of the current state (thread-safe)."""
    with self._lock:
        current_state = self.current_state.copy()
        updated_state = self._deep_update(current_state, updates)
        self.set_state(updated_state)
```

## 10. Configuration Management

The digital twin system uses a centralized Constants Service for configuration:

```python
# Get digital twin configuration
constants = ConstantsService()
dt_config = constants.get_digital_twin_config()

# Access specific parameters
update_frequency = dt_config.get("DIGITAL_TWIN_CONFIG", {}).get("update_frequency", 1.0)
history_length = dt_config.get("DIGITAL_TWIN_CONFIG", {}).get("history_length", 1000)
```

## 11. Error Handling

The digital twin system implements comprehensive error handling:

1. Public methods catch exceptions and log errors
2. Critical operations publish error events
3. Operations continue functioning when parts of the system fail
4. The system attempts to maintain last known good state on failure

Example implementation:

```python
def simulate(self, steps=None, parameters=None):
    """Run simulation with error handling."""
    try:
        # Simulation logic
        return simulation_results
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Simulation error: {str(e)}")
        self.event_publisher.publish_error_event(
            error_type="SimulationError",
            error_message=str(e)
        )
        return []
```

## 12. Performance Considerations

1. State updates are designed to be lightweight
2. State history is limited to prevent memory issues
3. Heavy processing is performed asynchronously when possible
4. The system is designed to handle real-time constraints
5. Configuration parameters control simulation detail level

## 13. Future Architectural Extensions

1. **Distributed Digital Twin**: Support for distributed components
2. **Micro-service Architecture**: Break components into separate services
3. **Real-time Data Processing**: Enhanced streaming data support
4. **Multi-twin Federation**: Support for multiple connected digital twins
5. **Cloud Integration**: Deployment to cloud infrastructure
